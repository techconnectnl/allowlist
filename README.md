# Whitelist for UniFi Ad Blocking

Domains allowed for Ad blocking

While the UniFi Ad Blocking is a basic system with good intentions, it can sometimes block to many things and will break some sites or services by default. With this list we try to add domains that are always allowed, which can be added to the UniFi system, to make sure things keep working.

This list includes domains that are better to be whitelisted when using the UniFi Ad Blocking option. For example the Google ads via google search, which some people use to find deals online. But also things like NLZiet, Hotjar (which is needed for some services), cookielaw stuff and others collected over the last couple of months.

To add this simply go to your UniFi Network Settings:

- Settings > Cybersecure > Content Filter
- Create New

Add the domains to the Allowlist part at the bottom.
